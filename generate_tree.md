# Guide

1. Click the link above the launch the interactive notebook. Your first action should be the 'fast-forward' button on the upper toolbar to activate the widgets
2. Upload your file in .newick format. **Make sure none of the node names have () in, this will result in invalid Newick.**
3. One by one, pick a colour you'd like some nodes to be, plus the legend title. Shift click to select multiple in a row. Submit each until you're done.
4. Pick a filename (no extension needed), a height and a width for the output then hit generate.
5. Wait a few moments for it to generate. You can now download the .svg and .png files by clicking the folder icon to the left, finding the file, and picking download from the drop-down menu.
